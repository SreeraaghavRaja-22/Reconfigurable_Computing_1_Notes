## Scheduling 
- Scheduling **assigns a start time** to each operation in DFG
	- Start times must not violate dependencies in DFG
	- Start times must meet performance constraints 
		- Alternatively, resource constraints 
- Performed on the DFG of each CFG node
	- Can't execute multiple CFG nodes in parallel 
---

### Scheduling Problems 
- Several types of scheduling problems 
	- Usually combination of **performance and resource** constraints 
- Problems:
	- Unconstrained 
		- Not useful since every schedule is valid 
	- **Minimum Latency**
		- easy to solve 
		- NOT NP-Complete
	- **Latency constrained** 
		- easy to solve 
		- NOT NP-Complete
	- **Minimum-latency, resource constrained** 
		- find the schedule with the shortest latency, that uses less than the specified number of resources 
		- **NP-Complete**
	- **Minimum-Resource, latency constrained**
		- find the schedule that meets the latency constraint (can be anything)
			- uses the minimum number of resources 
			- NP-Complete
---
### Minimum Latency Scheduling 
- **ASAP (as soon as possible) algorithm** 
	- Find a **candidate node**
		- A node whose predecessors have been scheduled and completed (or has no predecessors)
	- Schedule node on cycle later than max cycle of predecessor 
	- Repeat until all nodes are scheduled 
	- Example:  ![[Pasted image 20251025234526.png]]
		- Minimum Possible Latency = 4 cycles 
- **ALAP (as late as possible) algorithm**
	- Run ASAP, get minimum latency L 
	- Find a candidate 
		- A node whose successors are scheduled (or has none)
	- Schedule a node one cycle before min cycle of successor 
		- Nodes with no successors schedule to cycle L 
	- Repeat until all nodes scheduled 
	- Why ALAP?
		- Has to run ASAP first, seems pointless
		- But, many heuristics need the **mobility/slack** of each operation 
			- ASAP gives earliest possible time for an operation 
			- ALAP gives latest possible time for an operation 
		- **Slack:** difference between earliest and latest possible schedule 
			- Slack = 0 implies operation has been done in the current cycle 
			- Larger slack = more options a heuristic has to schedule the operation 
---

### Scheduling with Resource Constraints 
- Instead of finding the minimum latency, find latency less than L 
	- **Solutions:**
		- Use ASAP, verify that minimum latency is less than L 
		- Use ALAP starting with cycle L instead of minimum latency (don't need ASAP)
